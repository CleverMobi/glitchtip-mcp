## Authentication

This server uses Bearer token authentication. Your API token needs specific scopes depending on which tools you want to use:

### Required Scopes

| Tool | Required Scopes |
|------|----------------|
| `get_issue`, `list_issues`, `list_events` | `event:read` |
| `list_projects`, `get_project` | `project:read` |
| `get_organization` | `org:read` |
| `list_teams` | `team:read` |

### Minimum Token Scopes

- For basic project/org information: `project:read`, `org:read`, `team:read`, `member:read`
- For full functionality including issues: `project:read`, `org:read`, `team:read`, `member:read`, `event:read`

To create an API token in Glitchtip:
1. Go to your Glitchtip instance
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ API Tokens
3. Create a new token with the required scopes

## Testing

Test the server functionality:
```bash
# Run basic tests
node test-get-issue.js
```

## Troubleshooting

### 403 Forbidden Errors
If you receive 403 errors when accessing issues or events, your API token is missing the `event:read` scope. Create a new token with the appropriate scopes.

### 401 Unauthorized Errors
Ensure your API token is valid and uses Bearer authentication format.

### Connection Issues
Verify your `GLITCHTIP_API_ENDPOINT` is correct and accessible.
